This is the Enhanced Duke (EDuke) readme

EDuke is additional functionality to Duke Nukem 3D(TM) from 3D Releams.
It was created from the original Duke source code by Matt Saettler.

It allows MOD makers to have many more features in their work.

Detailed technical information and a list of MODs that take advantage of 
EDuke is available at www.saettler.com/EDuke

EDuke was programed by Matt Saettler.

Usurper's Notes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This release took far, far longer than it should have.  I truly wanted to be able
to have a working, ready-to-compile source release, but alas, I am not a programmer.
The programmers that I have shown it to have been unable to compile it.  There are
a few missing files, it seems.  If anyone is able to sort out the problem, perhaps
culling the correct files from other Duke3D source releases (or modifying those files
to work properly with Eduke 2.0) please let us know and we will update this archive.

These were Mr. Saettler's notes regarding the missing files:

>Types.h, develop.h and scriplib.h are all from the MACT library.  I didn't
>back them up because they're not part of the source I was modifying.
>
>If you don't have the types.h in mact, the compiler may pick up a different
>types.h (since it's supposed to be a system include   )
>
>I couldn't find file-lib.h anywhere

Mr. Saettler kindly provided his mact file (see mact.zip).  I hope the included files
will allow somebody to piece together a working, compilable version of Eduke 2.0.

For information on Eduke's con language additions, there are two lengthy guides at
